## About
This is a project I made during the second year of my DUT degree. The goal was to use the knowledge we had acquired during the several classes we took. 
The only constraint we had, besides the programming language, was the topic which was the following: "Around the K building".

### Story
You are student who has failed all of his classes. Your only hope is to cheat in order to graduate. Collect the grades and avoid getting caught by the teachers.
During this year, you also mastered the ability to become invisible. Take advantage of that power to sneak around more easily.
